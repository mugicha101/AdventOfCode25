# Advent of Code 2025 in Golang

to add inputs: `input/day1.txt` \
to run all: `go run . all` \
to run a certain day: `go run . day1` \
to run a certain day and part: `go run . day1a` or `go run . day1b` (doesn't work for day 12) \
to run all without 10b: `go run no10b` (total runtime on my laptop is ~100ms with ~90ms being 10b and ~3ms being 8b) \
